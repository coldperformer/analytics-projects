# Introduction

- For many of us, work is a major part of our lives where we spend much of our time to make income and friends.

- Having a fulfilling job can be good for your mental health and general wellbeing.

- Mental health is the way we think and feel and our ability to deal with ups and downs and it is something we all have.

- When we enjoy good mental health, we have a sense of purpose and direction, the energy to do the things we want to do.

- If you enjoy good mental health, you can:

    - make the most of your potential

    - cope with what life throws at you

    - play a full part in your relationships, your workplace, and your community.

- Your mental health always fluctuates as circumstances change as you move through different stages in your life.

- Distress is a word used to describe times when a person isn’t coping – for whatever reason.

- It could be something at home, the pressure of work, or the start of a mental health problem like depression.

- When we feel distressed, we need a compassionate, human response.
